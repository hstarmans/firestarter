# Firestarter
This repository provides three pcbs for controlling an open hardware fast high resolution laser.
Details can be found on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/21933-open-hardware-fast-high-resolution-laser). The code was developed by [Hexastorm](https://www.hexastorm.com).
The pcbs are; a cape for the beaglebone, a pcb to detect the start of the scanline and a pcb which acts as bridge between the Beaglebone and the modules in the scanhead. 
The cape is inspired by the Altium board of Salvatore Puglisi, the firestarter v0.1, and the board of Henner Zeller.

# Status
All boards have been verified and work. Controlling a spindle with the board has not been widely tested.
It is unknown if the board can handle the current required for moving a spindle.
The bill of materials for each board can be found in their subfolder.
