# Firestarter
This repository provides four pcbs for controlling an open hardware fast high resolution laser.
Details can be found on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/21933-open-hardware-fast-high-resolution-laser). 
The pcbs are; a hat for the raspberry, a cape for the beaglebone, a pcb to detect the start of the scanline and a pcb which acts as bridge between the main board and the modules in the scanhead. 


# Status
The raspberry pi hat is in development and works with a FPGA. 
The beaglebone board works with the 200 MHz pru on the bone. 
The bill of materials for each board can be found in their subfolder.

# Costs
Building board for 3 modules cost me around 130 euro's The components cost is 104 euro's at Farnell. I paid around 70 euro for 5 PCBs made by Eurocircuits. These had a gold finish and a delivery time of a couple of days. Later, I used PCBway at around 26 dollars and a lead time of 5 day. You roughly pay 1 euro per PCB here.
