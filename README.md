# Hexastorm PCB
This repository provides two folders;
 * **Laser module**  
    Contains six PCBs for the laser head. A box is created by the PCBs.  
    A baseboard, a front and back plate, a side plate and a top plate.  
    Furthermore, the folder has PCBs to create a laser prism scanner with a PCB motor.
    This is experimental. For commercial use, I recommend the connector plate in combination with a polygon mirror motor.  
 * **Base**  
    The base is made by two boards; a compute and extension board.
    The compute boards creates the commands using as ESP32 and FPGA. 
    The extension board can control three stepper motors and connect to the laserhead.  
    
    
A blog with progress updates is available on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/21933-open-hardware-fast-high-resolution-laser). 

# Status
Several systems were designed. A successful exposure is shown in this [video](https://youtu.be/dR09Tev0cPk).  
Current design is tested in december 2024.
