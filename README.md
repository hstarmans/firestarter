# Firestarter
This repository provides three pcbs for the hexastorm; a cape for the beaglebone, a pcb to detect the start of the scanline and a pcb which acts as bridge between the Beaglebone and the modules in the scanhead. 
The cape is inspired by the Altium board of Salvatore Puglisi, the firestarter v0.1, and the board of Henner Zeller.

# Status
The board is undergoing some major revisions.
