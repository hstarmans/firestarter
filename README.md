# Firestarter
This repository provides four pcbs for controlling an open hardware fast high resolution laser.
Details can be found on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/21933-open-hardware-fast-high-resolution-laser). 
The pcbs are; a hat for the raspberry, a pcb to detect the start of the scanline, a main board for the laser head and a board for the motors.
The housing of the laser scanner is made from circuit boards as well. They are located in the plates folder. 

# Status
The raspberry pi hat is in development and works with a FPGA. 
The beaglebone board works with the 200 MHz pru on the bone and is no longer in development.
The bill of materials for each board can be found in their subfolder.

# Costs
Building board for 3 modules cost me around 130 euro's The components cost is 104 euro's at Farnell. I paid around 70 euro for 5 PCBs made by Eurocircuits. These had a gold finish and a delivery time of a couple of days. Later, I used PCBway at around 26 dollars and a lead time of 5 day. You roughly pay 1 euro per PCB here.
